# URL-Shortener
<h3>Page Link: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.</li>
  <li>If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.</li>
  <li>When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.</li>
</ul>
